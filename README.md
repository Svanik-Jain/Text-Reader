## One last step to project completion!!!


#### All that is left for this to put the module that converts speech to text.
It will be used when:
  1. which page number is to be dictated                                      --------> go to line 13 in code
  2. what part is to be read again (variable name is "reread")                --------> go to line 39 in code
  3. whether the part read again is to be continued (variable name is "readon")-------> go to line 47 in code

All we have to do is to replace the input() function when speech to text answer.
Rest all is done!

*In case you haven't understood the code, I will properly explain everything in our next meeting*
